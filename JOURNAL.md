## 10/22/2025 - Locked in for 12 hours straight and completed the project  

I wanted a nice Chatbot that can talk to be used on my Smarthome dashboard and wear os devices. I could've made a basic python app but I wanted it to have an avatar and an expressive personality so its more like a friend.
I started with python and build a basic app with speechrecognition, google.genai and pyttsx(cuz its offline), I used a set of GIF images for different emotions and made those gifs callable by gemini. It outputs a json object with the response and an emotion, th epython script speaks out the response and changes the Gif accordingly.

Once this was sorted out..., I made a version with TS with a little help from an llm ;)

I then committed the proj to Github and hosted it with vercel
